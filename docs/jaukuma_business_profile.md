## 2. Products & Services

### 2. Flower Subscriptions *(steady B2B & B2C flow)*
- Weekly or bi-weekly flower delivery for offices, hotels, restaurants, and private homes
- Our subscription model is designed specifically for B2B clients. Unlike traditional consumer subscriptions, businesses don‚Äôt usually buy in a strict recurring way ‚Äî but they do need a constant, reliable supply. That‚Äôs why our model focuses on flexibility and convenience:

- At the end of the month, we issue a single consolidated invoice. This simplifies accounting and gives full transparency on usage.
- We also offer delivery directly to the client‚Äôs location, even during non-working or ‚Äúuncomfortable‚Äù hours. For example, many businesses need fresh bouquets early in the morning ‚Äî we can deliver at those times, ensuring their needs are met before the workday begins.
