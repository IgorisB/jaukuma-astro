Legal basis: Video data is processed on the basis of Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR – processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the data controller to protect its property and ensure security.

## 3. Monitored areas and data storage
Video cameras are installed in clearly visible locations and monitor self-service checkout areas, product shelves, and passages. The video is monitored in real-time and a digital recording is made.

Data retention period: Video recordings are stored for up to 30 days from the date of their capture.

At the end of this period, the recordings are automatically deleted (overwritten), unless they are related to an ongoing investigation of an incident, theft, fraud, or other violation of property or personal security. In such a case, the recordings are stored until the investigation is completed and/or until the relevant decision of the competent authority becomes final.

Your video data is confidential. It may be provided only in accordance with the law to the following entities:

Law enforcement authorities (police, prosecutor'''s office, court) upon their reasoned request in the investigation of criminal acts or other violations;

Right of access to data: You have the right to contact us with a request for information on whether we are processing your video data and, if so, to request access to it.

Right to erasure (‘right to be forgotten’): You can request the deletion of your video recording if it is processed unlawfully or if the purpose for which it was collected no longer exists (upon expiry of the storage period).

Right to restriction of processing: You can request to restrict the processing of your data (except for storage) until its accuracy is verified or your objection is being considered.

Right to object to data processing: As we process data on the basis of a legitimate interest, you have the right to object to such processing for reasons related to your particular situation.

To exercise these rights, you must submit a written request to us by email at bdar@jaukuma.lt, allowing us to clearly identify you. In the request, you must also specify as accurately as possible the date and time you were in the monitored area so that we can find the specific recording.

We inform you that your rights may be limited in cases provided for by law, when it is necessary to ensure the prevention, investigation of crimes, or public order.
